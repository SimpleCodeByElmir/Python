# Write a function named first_non_repeating_letterâ€  that takes
# a string input, and returns the first character that is not
# repeated anywhere in the string.

# For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should
# return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string,
# and occurs first in the string.

# As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered
# the same character, but the function should return the correct case
# for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS'
# should return 'T'.

# If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return
# an empty string ("").
